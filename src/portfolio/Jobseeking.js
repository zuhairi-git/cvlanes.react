                                    As the cost of living continues to rise, more and more individuals are seeking ways to supplement their income. Working on weekends is a popular option for those looking to increase their earnings, whether they are students, stay-at-home parents, or anyone else in need of extra cash. Weekend work offers flexibility and provides opportunities to develop new skills, meet new people, and pursue personal passions.
                                    There are several reasons why individuals may choose to work on weekends, including the desire for additional income, the flexibility to work around other commitments, the opportunity to develop new skills, the chance to network and meet new people, and the ability to pursue personal passions.
                                    To make this process easier, using a job-finding application that allows you to create a profile and showcase your skills and work history can be a highly efficient way to find weekend job opportunities in your local area.</p>

                                                    Allen is a 20-year-old vocational school student who uses the Job Seeking app occasionally, typically only once a month or every couple of months. He doesn't have a particular preference for any type of job and uses the app mainly as a way to earn extra money when he unexpectedly has free time or runs low on funds. Despite his tendency to cancel jobs at the last minute, customers report that Kevin is a diligent worker when he does show up. He is open to hard work and evening/night shifts, which are qualities appreciated by many employers. His primary job-seeking needs are centered around finding opportunities for the following evening or weekend, when he has free time and is willing to work for some extra cash.

                                    In the final phase of the design process, creating comprehensive design documentation is crucial. This documentation serves as a future reference, facilitating collaboration and maintenance of the design.
